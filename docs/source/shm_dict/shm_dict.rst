.. _shm_dict.shm_dict:

Shared Memory Dictionary
========================

 This is the Shared Memory Dictionary library that
 provides the SHMDict object. This dictionary may
 be kept only in RAM or can be synced to disk if
 persistence is required. A kernel semaphore
 ensures that the dictionary is thread and
 multi-process safe.
